    <tr><ul><b>Step 1</b></ul>
      <ul>Open your attention to the present moment. The invitation is to bring attention to our experience in a wider and more open manner that isn’t really involved with selecting or choosing or evaluating, but simply holding—becoming a container for thoughts feelings or sensations in the body that are present and seeing if we can watch them from one moment to the next.</ul></tr>
      <tr><ul><b>Step 2</b></ul>
      <ul>Focus on the breath. Let go of that widescreen and to bring a focus that’s much more concentrated and centered, so narrower, on breathing in one region of our bodies—the breath of the belly, or the chest, or the nostrils, or anywhere that the breath makes itself known, and keeping that more concentrated focus.</ul></tr>

<tr><ul><b>Step 3</b></ul>

<ul>Bring your attention to your body. move out to become aware of sensations in the body as a whole, sitting with the whole body, the whole breath, once again we move back to wider and spacious container of attention for our experience.</ul></tr>

    <h3>Mediation for Stress</h3>
    </summary>
    <table>
      <tr><ul><b>Step 1</b></ul>
      <ul>Get Into a Comfortable Position.
Choose where and how you'll sit. Many people like to sit in a comfortable chair while others prefer to sit cross-legged on the ground. You want to be able to completely relax while still staying awake.
Ensure that your posture is correct. It is easier to stay awake through long meditations if your back is straight. If you begin your meditation practice with this in mind, your body will become used to the position as you move on to longer periods of time.
If you choose to sit in a chair, sit toward the front of the seat and place your feet firmly on the floor. This will improve your posture and help you concentrate on your practice.</ul></tr>
      <tr><ul><b>Step 2</b></ul>
      <ul>Close Your Eyes Gently
When you are in a comfortable position, look into the distance with a soft gaze, then slowly lower your lids. Keep your jaw slack and slightly open as well. You want to relax all of your facial muscles.
Tip: Do not squeeze your eyes tight. If you feel your face tighten, slowly open your eyes, refocus on that soft gaze and lower them again.
At this stage, your goal is to relax every part of your body. If you feel some tension in certain parts of your body, take a deep breath and allow it to relax you.</ul></tr>

<tr><ul><b>Step 3</b></ul>

<ul>Put Thoughts Aside.
While you can't control your thoughts, you can control how much power they have over you. This doesn't mean you should ignore or suppress them, but simply remain calm, note them, and then use your breathing to bring you back to the moment. Learning to do this during your meditation practice can help you to let things go in the rest of your life as well.</ul></tr>
